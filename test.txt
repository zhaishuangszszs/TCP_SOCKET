Dear Sir ,I’m LiHua , a Chinese student taking summer course in your university . I’m writing to ask for help . I came here last month and found my courses interesting .But I have some difficulty with note-taking and I have no idea of how to use the library . I was told the learning center provides help for students and I’m anxious to get help from you. I have no class on Tuesdays mornings and Friday afternoons . Please let me know which day is ok with you. You may email or phone me . Here are my email address and phone number :lihua@1236.com ; 1234567.Look forward to your reply .
Most of us compare ourselves with anyone we think is happier — a relative, someone we know a lot, or someone we hardly know. As a result, what we do remember is anything that makes others happy, anything that makes ourselves unhappy, totally forgetting that there is something happy in our own life.
So the best way to destroy happiness is to look at something and focus on even the smallest flaw. It is the smallest flaw that would make us complain. And it is the complaint that leads to us becoming unhappy.
If one chooses to be happy, he will be blessed; if he chooses to be unhappy, he will be cursed. Happiness is just what you think will make you happy.
